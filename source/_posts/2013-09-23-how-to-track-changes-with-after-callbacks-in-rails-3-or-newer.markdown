You can track changes to a ActiveRecord model with `ActiveRecord::Dirty#changed?`. Yet there is one caveat though, the tracking is lost after the model is saved. In this tutorial I'll show how to track the changes to a record even the record has been saved, this comes handy when being used with ActiveRecord `after` callbacks

<!--more-->

Imagine that we have a `Product` model with `name`, we make change to `name` with:

```ruby
@product.name # => "Diamond"
@product.name = 'Ruby'
@product.changed? # => true
@product.name_changed? # => true
```

By using ActiveRecord::Dirty, we could tell if the model or attribute `name` is changed.

If we save our model

```ruby
@product.save
@product.changed? # => false
@product.name_changed? # => false
```

The `false` value indicates that ActiveRecord::Dirty is not persisent after the model is saved. What if now you are being asked to add in a code to notify the inventory system if product name is changed?

Well, luckily Rails provides us `previous_changes` method which entails what
changes has made previously.

```
@product.previous_changes # => {'name' => ['Diamond, 'Ruby']}
```

Let's see how we write this:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  after_update :notify_systtem_if_name_is_changed

  private

  def notify_systtem_if_name_is_changed
    notify_system if previous_changes['name'].any?
  end

end
```

We uses `after_update` callback to check if any changes previously
made to `name`. If so, we invoke `notify_system` method.

Alternatively, there is another way to write this code. That is to use
`around` callback. Here is details:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  around_update :notify_systtem_if_name_is_changed

  private

  def notify_systtem_if_name_is_changed
    name_changed = self.name_changed?

    yield

    notify_system if named_changed
  end

end
```

`around` callback is introduced in Rails 3. This callback consists of 3 parts:

* The part before `yield` is codes prior to the action is called
* The `yield` is action that gets called
* The part after `yield` is codes after the action is called

In our example above, we store the changing state of attribute `name` into `named_change` variable. The `yield` executes the `update` action. The changing state then can be referenced afterward and will send out notification if name is truly changed.

The `previous_changes` is convenient to tell if changes are made to attributes.
I hope that you should take advantage of it more. See you in the next tutorial.
