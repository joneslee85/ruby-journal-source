In this tutorial, I'll show you how to do jQuery UI Autocomplete the better way with Capybara 2!
That is getting rid of `sleep` that many solutions on the Internet suggested. Furthermore this
solution works both with selenium and polstergeist driver.

If you search on the Internet on how to do autocomplete with capybara, you'll normally find
solutions for Capybara 1.x like below:

```ruby
s.fill_in "Make", :with => "Make"
sleep 3
page.execute_script("$('.ui-menu-item a:contains(\"Make Two\")').trigger('mouseenter').click();")
```

It was a fine solution however the `sleep` call is not good. It tells the driver to passively
sleep while waiting for JS loading up. As of Capybara 2, there is no need to call `sleep` as
finder API will actively look for existence of the node and raise error if not found. Here is
a better solution:

```ruby
def fill_autocomplete(field, options = {})
  fill_in field, with: options[:with]

  page.execute_script %Q{ $('##{field}').trigger('focus') }
  page.execute_script %Q{ $('##{field}').trigger('keydown') }
  selector = %Q{ul.ui-autocomplete li.ui-menu-item a:contains("#{options[:select]}")}

  page.should have_selector('ul.ui-autocomplete li.ui-menu-item a')
  page.execute_script %Q{ $('#{selector}').trigger('mouseenter').click() }
end
```

To use it, you call:

```ruby
fill_autocomplete('field_id', with: 'term')
```

Please be noted that `field` parameter must be the CSS ID, not label nor name.

Let me digest the above code, first, I fill in the text field and I want the autocomplete
to kick in by trigger focus and keydown event on the field using JS. Then I check
the existence of `li.ui-menu-item a` instead of doing `sleep` to ensure that the JS
has popped the dropdown correctly. The final step is just to trigger mouseentter event to
do mouse hover then click.

Using `have_selector` is definitely a nicer way to check for JS initialization and I
encourage you apply this technique as often as possible. You'll thank me later for saving
you from randomly failed test. That's all for now. Good day!
